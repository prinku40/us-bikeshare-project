Introduction:
 The project involves exploring bike share data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to analyze and compute descriptive statistics from the data to answer interesting questions about bike share usage patterns in these cities.

To accomplish this, you will write code in Python to import the data and perform various calculations and analyses. You will use data structures like lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate the data. Additionally, you will use loops and conditional statements to process the data correctly.

The project also requires you to create an interactive experience in the terminal using raw input. This means that your code should prompt the user for input and handle it correctly. You should implement error handling to avoid any issues with invalid inputs.

In summary, the project involves exploring bike share data, computing descriptive statistics, and creating an interactive terminal experience to present the results. By completing this project, you will demonstrate your understanding of foundational programming concepts and your ability to work with real-world data.


Project Files: 

1.bikeshare.py: This is the main Python script file where you will write your code to import the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive terminal experience. Make sure to include all the necessary functions and code required to complete the project.

2. readme.txt: This is a text file where you will document any external resources you used, provide an explanation of your code, mention any challenges faced, and summarize your overall experience working on the project. Refer to my previous response for more details on what to include in the readme.txt file.

External Resources: 

Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/

This is the official documentation for the Python programming language. It provides detailed information about Python syntax, built-in functions, and libraries. It can be a valuable resource for understanding and using Python effectively.
Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. The official documentation provides comprehensive information about the various functions and methods available in Pandas. It can be helpful for working with data frames and performing data analysis tasks.
NumPy Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. The documentation provides detailed explanations of NumPy arrays, mathematical functions, and other features. It can be useful for performing numerical computations and working with multi-dimensional arrays.


Code Explanation:

The code I provided is a skeleton structure for a Python script that can be used to analyze bikeshare data. Let's go through the main components of the code:

main() function: This is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to input the city, month, and day of the week they want to analyze. It also contains the mappings for month names and day names.

load_data() function: This function is responsible for loading and filtering the dataset based on the user's input. It takes in the city, month, and day as parameters. Inside this function, you would implement the steps mentioned in the practice problem, such as loading the dataset, creating month and day columns, and filtering the data based on the specified month and day.

other_function() function: This is a placeholder function that you can replace with any other analysis or functionality you want to implement. It takes in the month and day as parameters. You can use this function to perform additional analysis on the filtered data or implement any other functionality you need.

if __name__ == "__main__": block: This block ensures that the main() function is only called if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). This allows you to import this script into other scripts without executing the main function automatically.

By implementing the load_data() function and potentially adding more functions for analysis, you can use this script to load and filter bikeshare data based on user input, and perform various analyses on the filtered data.



Challenges Faced: 

Debugging can be a challenge when you encounter errors or unexpected behavior in your code. To overcome this, you can use print statements or debugging tools like the Python debugger (pdb) to trace the flow of your code and identify the source of the error. Additionally, breaking down your code into smaller functions and testing them individually can help isolate and fix issues more easily



Conclusion: 

Throughout the project, I learned several key lessons and takeaways:

Data Analysis with Python: This project allowed me to practice and enhance my data analysis skills using Python. I learned how to import and manipulate data, compute descriptive statistics, and present the results in an interactive manner.

Handling User Input: Soliciting and handling raw user input was an important aspect of this project. I learned how to prompt the user for input, handle different cases, and implement error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

Code Organization and Documentation: Writing clean and well-organized code is crucial for readability and maintainability. I learned the importance of using meaningful variable names, adding comments, and writing docstrings to document my code effectively.

Problem Solving and Debugging: This project challenged me to think critically and solve problems that arose during the development process. I gained experience in debugging errors, optimizing code efficiency, and finding alternative approaches to overcome challenges.
